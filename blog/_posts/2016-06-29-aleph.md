    Over the past six months, I've been working for OCCRP to productise Aleph, a
    powerful search tool for investigative reporters. This is a little tour of
    it's key features, and a little view into the future development agenda.

In a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, the Aleph is a point in space that contains
all others. To those who see it, it presents the entire universe at once - an
investigative reporter's dream. 

Over the past six months, I've been working for OCCRP to [productise a tool named
after this mythical object](https://data.occrp.org). It's based on a prototype I hacked up as part of my
2014 Knight Fellowship, and it has now grown into a data research tool as part of
the Investigative Dashboard.

        reporting, companies registries and gazette notices.

At it's base, Aleph allows users to search through large collections
of documents and data tables. On ID Search, over 100 sources include material as
diverse as the Kyrgyz companies register, the US State Department cables, the
Gazettes of Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and many other countries, or
the UK parliament's inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko.

What's more, anybody can upload their own private document collections - whether
they are documents, databases, scans, or e-mail archives. Aleph will make them searchable
for anyone who is granted access. It will also cross-reference documents with
extensive watchlists composed of the world's sanctions lists, wanted criminals,
national politicians and persons and companies that have been investigated previously.

    <div class="caption">

        politicians (PEPs) and the subjects of previous reporting.
    </div>
</div>

Increasingly, Aleph also extracts structured details from documents: email addresses,
phone numbers, web addresses are supported now. Further data points like bank accounts,
VAT IDs, dates and monetary amounts will be added soon to give users ever more ways
to dissect and filter the data and find what they need.

        a list of companies and people they are interested in. 
    </div>
</div>

Custom watchlists can also be created by reporters to keep track of individuals and
companies in a systematic way, so they can be notified whenever new mentions are
found in uploaded documents, or in the growing number of public data sources which
Aleph automatically harvests on a regular basis.

## Building investigative memory

Aleph is designed to support people who do investigative research on two levels: in
their day-to-day work, and in a more strategic sense. Day to day, it is a research
tool that finds your next lead or helps you analyze a pile of documents from a
leak when you are right in the middle of an investigation.

But in the long run, it's also a way for reporters to build up a living archive - both
of source material, but more importantly of structured information about the people
and companies that they are interested in. This juxtaposition of structured data and
unstructured documents is the bet that we're making with Aleph.

<div class="captioned">
    <img src="/assets/images/aleph/entity_aliases.png" class="img-responsive">
    <div class="caption">
        Building detailed, structured datasets based on previous investigations
        allows for better cross-referencing of documents and entities.
    </div>
</div>

This helps individuals and organisations to keep track of what they know and what
they need, but it can also be a way to create collaborations between researchers.
Using the "peek" function, the tool connects those who hold private documents with
those who searched for terms within these documents. This will hopefully also link
into ICIJ's decentralised DataShare tool, which has similar objectives.

        Letting users "peek" into the private collections of others is meant to 
        foster collaborations.

## What's the verb for 'data'?

The key in designing Aleph, however, is to serve practical research needs: finding
key documents quickly, getting alerted to new information, or mapping out the
major actors in a particular story.

Experimenting with how these can be made into interactions that people will
routinely engage with is the hardest aspect of this project. Few investigators will
adopt data-management tools if there is not a concrete and immediate pay-off in terms
of additional insights that are not trivial.

For me, aleph is also the next step in a learning process that I started with
[Grano](http://granoproject.org), an influence mapping tool. Aleph represents a
more task-focussed, incremental approach towards to making a practical toolkit
for investigative reporting.

Of course, it is also free software, which is used both by the ID team at OCCRP, and by
[OpenOil's Aleph project](http://aleph.openoil.net), after originally being
prototyped at Code for Africa. We'd love to see more organisations and companies
[adopt it and contribute their own features](https://github.com/pudo/aleph).
